This is my third attempt.
My name is WangZhen, 
I'm 34 years old. 
I grew up in a fertile plain where agriculture was developed but industry and commerce were lagging behind.

Now I begin to learn software and look forward to making contributions to my hometown in the future.
Although I don't have any foundation, I determine to keep learning
